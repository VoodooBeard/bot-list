# Twitch Bot Account
List of known bots on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv).

Feel free to ban these accounts at your own risk. Twitch openly is allowing people to use "Chat Scrapr Bots" like [this one](https://github.com/zya6yu/twitch-scraper-bot) , therefore allowing the inflation of Viewer Counts. 

They are collecting users data without "their" (their being the streamers) permission, which is against Data Protection Laws in most countries including the European Union Countries. Not only is it against Data Protection Laws (example: GDPR), it is also against [Twitch Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/#9-prohibited-conduct) and is listed as Prohibited Conduct.

This needs to end and it starts here....
